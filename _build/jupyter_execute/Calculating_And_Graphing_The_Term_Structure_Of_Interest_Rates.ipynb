    "It’s good practice to import all required libraries and modules in the first code cell of a Notebook. Unless a new function or module is being introduced, this chapter follows this practice. If a library is already installed, it’s imported to the Notebook. If a library isn’t installed, it’s installed and then imported.\n",

The imports <font color='green'>os</font> and <font color='green'>sys</font> facilitate interaction with the operating system. The <font color='green'>requests</font> module enables sending and retrieving data from external URLs; in this notebook, the module is specifically used to access files from Dropbox. The <font color='green'>types</font> module lets us create the module from the Python code accessed from Dropbox. Finally, <font color='green'>datetime</font> allows for the creation and manipulation of date objects.\n",

The <font color='green'>diff()</font> method subtracts the lower indexed value from the higher&mdash;in this example, the maturity of four weeks from eight weeks and eight weeks from thirteen and so on. The calculation of forward rates is the reverse (or the negative) value of the <font color='green'>diff()</font> method. This negative value is assigned to the <font color='green'>forward_rates</font> array. The <font color='green'>diff()</font> function returns four values (there is no forward rate for the first month). To align the spot and forward rates on the graph, a dummy value, <font color='green'>nan</font>, is inserted in the forward-rate array. The NumPy method <font color='green'>insert()</font> is used to add a column with <font color='green'>nan</font> as the first column of the <font color='green'>forward_rates</font> array.
