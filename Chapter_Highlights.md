This chapter uses the Python libraries Pandas and NumPy. The basic usage of these libraries is detailed in two Notebooks: "[A Quick Introduction to Pandas](https://patrickjhess.github.io/Introduction-To-Python-For-Financial-Python/An_Introduction_To_Pandas.html)" reviews some basic concepts of Pandas, and "[A Quick Introduction to NumPy](https://patrickjhess.github.io/Introduction-To-Python-For-Financial-Python/An_Introduction_To_NumPy.html)" does the same for NumPy. These Notebooks are part of the introductory volume [Background Material: An Introduction to Python for Financial Python](https://patrickjhess.github.io/Introduction-To-Python-For-Financial-Python/intro.html). Portions of the volume will be cited throughout this chapter. Feel free to consult these materials as needed for greater discussion of Python concepts.

**The Chapter includes five sections.**

1. *Introduction to Bond Pricing* covers some  basic concepts. 
2. The  Jupyter notebook *NumPy and Pandas* introduces and illustrates the modules. 
3. The  Jupyter notebook *Calculating And Graphing The Term Structure Of Interest Rates* uses NumPy and Pandas to:
   * download data from DropBox that is used to calculate and graph the term structure on September 15$^{th}$ 2022.
   * download data from the U.S. Treasury that is used to calculate and graph the term structure on September 30$^{th}$ 2025
   * an exercise asking you to calculate and plot spot and forward rates with data downloaded from the U.S. Treasury.
4. *Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Financial Insights* summarizes the financial concepts and results.
5. *Functions Imported By Basic Concepts Of Fixed Income* descries the functions imported from DropBox (*module_basic_concepts_fixed_income*)..
