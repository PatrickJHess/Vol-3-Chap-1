# Functions Imported By the Volume *Basic Concepts Of Fixed Income*

Chapter One's notebook imports two helper functions:

1. ***save_results:*** This function helps track files generated by notebooks that are saved. 
2. ***one_y_axis:*** This function utilizes the matplotlib library to graph multiple series on a single y-axis.

Both functions are part of a module downloaded from DropBox. These and other functions within the module are intended to shift focus from coding to financial concepts.
