## Basic Concepts of Fixed Income

### Chapter One: Basic Bond Concepts and the Term Structure of Interest Rates
  
Chapter One, *Basic Concepts Of Fixed Income*, introduces the foundational principles of bond pricing. A primary focus of this chapter is calculating the term structure of interest rates, an essential gauge of financial market health, using data from U.S. Treasury Bills (T-bills).

T-bills are short-term financial instruments, maturing in one year or less, that make a single payment at maturity. This chapter uses downloaded T-bill data to compute both forward and spot interest rates for various dates.

To facilitate the necessary data analysis, the chapter also introduces the fundamental Python libraries extensively used in *Financial Python*: Pandas and NumPy. NumPy is essential for efficient numerical computations. Pandas provides the powerful DataFrame structure, which is akin to a spreadsheet but significantly more effective for performing complex calculations, particularly with large datasets.
